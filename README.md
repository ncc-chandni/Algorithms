## Algorithms from scratch using Python
Writing algorithms from scratch helps better understand the workings of machine learning. It develops intuition and deepens comprehension of how models function, how data is processed, and how various parameters influence outcomes. By implementing algorithms manually, one gains insight into the core mathematical concepts and logic that drive machine learning, leading to better problem-solving skills and the ability to debug and optimize models effectively.
